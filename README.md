# turing-test-v2
Used to host a turing test

## How to use

Start the tester on one machine:

    python tester.py
  
It's important that the tester is started first as this will work as the server hosting the test.
Then, start the subject (of the test) on another machine:

    python subject.py
 
Follow the instructions given on the screen, and have fun :)
